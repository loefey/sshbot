# sshbot
This is just a simple discord bot that you can use to connect to a server or whatever and run terminal commands from a discord channel. It was just something simple and maybe usefull that I could post on my GitHub. Please feel free to edit it however you'd like and no credit is needed, you may also make pull requests and I'll make sure to look over them!
